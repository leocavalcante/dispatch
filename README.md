# dispatch()

üïäÔ∏è Event dispatcher awareness made simple.

## Install

```shell
composer require leocavalcante/dispatch:dev-main
```

## Usage

### Define a dispatcher

It can be anyone that implements the [PSR-14 Event Dispatcher Interface](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-14/).

```shell
use function Dispatch\use_dispatcher;
use_dispatcher(Psr\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface);
```

### Then just call `dispatch()`

```shell
use function Dispatch\dispatch;
dispatch(new MyEvent());
```

The idea is exactly to make it able to dispatch events from anywhere in your code avoiding `EventDispatcherInterface` injection boilerplate.

## Example

```php
use League\Event\EventDispatcher;
use function Dispatch\{dispatch, use_dispatcher};

class UpperCased {
    public function __construct(
        public string $result,
    ) {}
}

function to_upper(string $str): string {
    // Do something
    $upper_case_str = strtoupper($str);

    // And dispatch an Event without EventDispatcherInterface injection boilerplate
    dispatch(new UpperCased($upper_case_str));

    return $upper_case_str;
}

class UpperCauser {
    public function toUpper(string $str): string {
        // Do something
        $upper_case_str = strtoupper($str);

        // And dispatch an Event without EventDispatcherInterface injection boilerplate
        dispatch(new UpperCased($upper_case_str));

        return $upper_case_str;
    }
}

$dispatcher = new EventDispatcher();
$dispatcher->subscribeTo(UpperCased::class, static function (UpperCased $event): void {
    echo "Some string was upper cased and it is: {$event->result}\n";
});

use_dispatcher($dispatcher);

to_upper('dispatch');
(new UpperCauser())->toUpper('rocks!');

// Some string was upper cased and it is: DISPATCH
// Some string was upper cased and it is: ROCKS!
```

## Dispatchers

As said, this is only a small Facade on top of `EventDispatcherInterface` providing namespaced functions to reduce dispatcher injection boilerplate.

You still need a concrete implementation of an Event Dispatcher, anyone that implements the `EventDispatcherInterface` can be used, but here is a list of a few of them:

- [The PHP League Event](https://event.thephpleague.com/) (my personal favorite, used on tests and examples)
- [Laminas EventManager](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-eventmanager/)
- [Symfony EventDispatcher](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher.html)
- [Doctrine Event Manager](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/event-manager.html)
- ~~[√âv√©nement](https://github.com/igorw/evenement/issues/73)~~

## FAQ

### Does it compromise my tests?

**It shouldn't**. Unless you are testing that your module (class, function, method etc) is dispatching an Event, than it does not interfere the module's behavior.

#### In case you want to test if the module is dispatching an Event.

And want to inject your fixture/stub/mock for `EventDispatcherInterface`, you can always just call `use_dispatcher()` in the test code or test setup.
*The tricky part is that this dispatcher will be used globally all along.*
But you can always call `desuse_dispatcher()` from your tests teardown.

### Doesn't it make my module dependency implicit?

**Yes, it does**. You have to think about `dispatch()` as like a PHP core/built-in function and as if event dispatching is a core part of your application. You model your domain on top of it.

**But remember**, it depends on `EventDispatcherInterface` **only**! It is an interface that can receive any concrete implementation **and** is a accepted and consolidated PSR interface.

### Conclusion

Trade-offs you should accept to pay are:

- The extra handling of the global `EventDispatcherInterface` on tests that should be isolated.
- Vendor lock-in on this project as if it is a superset of PHP, since you will be not injecting interfaces.
*Unless you create your own `dispatch()` function under the `Dispatch` namespace (that is why this namespace name is so generic).*

If these are ok to you. **Happy coding!** I'm sure it will make your event-driven apps pleasant to code with reduce boilerplate.
